Statistical Analysis of Silver and Golden Token Detection Algorithms

This repository contains the necessary files and documentation for conducting a comprehensive statistical analysis on two distinct implementations of algorithms developed by Natnael Berhanu Takele (S5446838) and Mustafa Melih Toslak (S5431021). The objective of this analysis is to compare the performance of these algorithms in locating silver and golden tokens within a randomized environment.
